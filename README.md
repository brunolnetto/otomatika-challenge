# Otomatika challenge: News scrapping

This repository contains the task required to scrap news from a online newspaper Gothamist [1]. The required task suggests to utilize selenium as scrap tooling. This code author chooses to perform adhoc calls, since they are easier than wrestling with a new tooling. This code directly queries the search url with desired search token, scraps the API calls and perform these calls itself. The resulting JSON data is rich in information, allowing to indexate the requested information itself in a dataframe.

## Running

#### VS Code
1. Get [Robocorp Code](https://robocorp.com/docs/developer-tools/visual-studio-code/extension-features) -extension for VS Code.
1. You'll get an easy-to-use side panel and powerful command-palette commands for running, debugging, code completion, docs, etc.
